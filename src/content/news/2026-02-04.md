## [Attention at Constant Cost per Token via Symmetry-Aware Taylor Approximation](https://github.com/glassroom/sata_attention)
* A new self-attention mechanism is proposed that achieves constant cost per token [https://papers.cool/arxiv/2602.00294]
* The method leverages Symmetry-Aware Taylor Approximation to efficiently compute self-attention to arbitrary precision [https://arxiv.org/html/2602.00294v1]
* A reference implementation of this self-attention mechanism is available [https://github.com/glassroom/sata_attention]

## [A case study in PDF forensics: The Epstein PDFs](https://pdfa.org/a-case-study-in-pdf-forensics-the-epstein-pdfs)
* The case study analyzes the Epstein PDFs from a forensic perspective, focusing on how conforming PDF software processes the files by applying updates incrementally from the end [https://pdfa.org/a-case-study-in-pdf-forensics-the-epstein-pdfs]
* The analysis highlights a hidden document information dictionary within the PDFs that is not referenced in the final incremental update trailer [https://pdfa.org/a-case-study-in-pdf-forensics-the-epstein-pdfs]
