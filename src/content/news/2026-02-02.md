# ☕ Daily Tech Briefing
## [Nano-vLLM: How a vLLM-style inference engine works](https://huggingface.co/blog/zamal/introduction-to-nano-vllm)
* nano-vLLM is a minimal reimplementation of vLLM, comprising approximately 1200 lines of Python code, designed for lightweight and low-latency LLM inference [https://huggingface.co/blog/zamal/introduction-to-nano-vllm]
* nano-vLLM utilizes Hugging Face tokenizers for input text preprocessing and can leverage `flash-attn` if installed [https://huggingface.co/blog/zamal/introduction-to-nano-vllm]
* nano-vLLM wraps the generation loop in a CUDA Graph (if supported) and supports basic tensor parallelism using `torch.distributed` [https://huggingface.co/blog/zamal/introduction-to-nano-vllm]

## [Geologists may have solved mystery of Green River's 'uphill' route](https://x.com/hackernewstop5/status/2018343464023597458)
* Geologists may have solved the mystery of the Green River's 'uphill' route [https://x.com/hackernewstop5/status/2018343464023597458]
* Recent geological research suggests the Green River's path through Utah's Uinta Mountains was shaped by specific geological processes [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/phys-org_geologists-may-have-solved-mystery-of-green-activity-7424074662143455233-AkGn]

## [My fast zero-allocation webserver using OxCaml](https://anil.recoil.org/notes/oxcaml-httpz)
* The author built a fast, zero-allocation webserver using OxCaml [https://lobste.rs/s/uveyjh/my_very_fast_zero_allocation_webserver]
* OxCaml allows for performance optimization by choosing between heap vs local allocation, or copy vs reference [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46854534]
* httpz is a high-performance HTTP/1.1 parser built with OxCaml, utilizing unboxed types and local allocations to achieve zero heap allocation [https://anil.recoil.org/notes/oxcaml-httpz]
